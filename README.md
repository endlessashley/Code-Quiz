 Online Quiz for Bootcamp 6/26/21

 For this assignment, I created an online quiz using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

 The quiz is timed, and 10 seconds are deducted from the time for each incorrect answer (though I've found the timer to be quite laggy). 

 I wrote the code to populate the score, and the high score list to be saved in local storage, but it does not work and I spent about 12 hours today trying to figure out why. If my grader has any insights, I'd be so grateful!
